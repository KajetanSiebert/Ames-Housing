# Ames-Housing

Dataset was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/lespin/house-prices-dataset.
I am also adding a file "data_description" that is documentation of this dataset.

The Ames Housing dataset contains explanatory variables describing every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa with the goal of predicting the selling price. In this short notebook we wiil try to clean data (dealing with missing data, incorrect data types) and provide descriptive statistics with visualization.

The project was done with use of python in Jupyter notebook. The project is in file "Data cleaning, descriptive statistics - Ames Housing Dataset.ipynb" and it can be viewed directly on github.
